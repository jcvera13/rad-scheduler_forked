## PART 1: Pattern Analysis

### Weekday Coverage Patterns

**Typical Weekday (Monday-Friday):**
- **Inpatient:** 4-6 radiologist-shifts
  - M0 (helper): 1 radiologist (remote, 2 hours)
  - M1 (on-site): 1 radiologist (8 hours)
  - M2 (remote): 1 radiologist (8 hours)
  - M3 (evening): 1 radiologist (remote, 6 hours)
  - O'Toole (Tue/Wed/Fri): 1 radiologist (subspecialty mammography)
  - Cardiac (concurrent): 1 radiologist (runs simultaneously with hospital shift)

- **Outpatient:** 6-8 radiologist-shifts
  - Remote coverage: 3-5 radiologists (MRI, Breast, General, PET)
  - On-site coverage: 2-4 radiologists (Washington/Encinitas/Poway/National City)
  - Skull Base (concurrent): 1 radiologist (subspecialty, runs simultaneously with outpatient)

- **Daily Total:** 10-13 radiologist-shifts

**Weekend Coverage (Saturday-Sunday):**
- **Inpatient:** 3 radiologist-shifts
  - M0 Weekend: 1 radiologist
  - EP (Early Person): 1 radiologist (on-site Sat, remote Sun)
  - LP/Dx-CALL (Late Person): 1 radiologist (remote)

- **Outpatient:** 0-2 radiologist-shifts
  - Weekend MRI: 1 radiologist (when scheduled)
  - Weekend PET: 1 radiologist (when scheduled)

- **Daily Total:** 3-5 radiologist-shifts

## PART 2: Key Observations

### 1. Simultaneous On-Site + Remote Coverage (Same Modality)

**MRI Coverage:**
```
Monday 10/6:
  - Remote MRI: 2 radiologists (James Cooper, JuanCarlos Vera)
  - On-site MRI (Encinitas): 1 radiologist (Karen Yuan)
  â†’ 3 MRI radiologists working simultaneously

Tuesday 10/7:
  - Remote MRI: 1 radiologist (Eric Chou)
  - On-site MRI (Washington): 1 radiologist (JuanCarlos Vera)
  â†’ 2 MRI radiologists working simultaneously
```

**Breast Coverage:**
```
Thursday 10/9:
  - Remote Breast: 2 radiologists (James Cooper, Kriti Rishi)
  â†’ Multiple radiologists covering remote breast simultaneously

Friday 10/10:
  - On-site Breast (Washington): 1 radiologist (Rowena Tena)
  - Remote Breast: (varies by day)
```

**Interpretation:** 
- MRI and Breast imaging have **both remote and on-site coverage simultaneously**
- This suggests high volume requiring parallel workflows
- Different radiologists can have location preferences (on-site vs remote)

### 2. Concurrent Subspecialty Assignments

**James Cooper Pattern:**
```
Monday 10/6:
  - Remote MRI (outpatient) + Skull Base (subspecialty)
  â†’ Working 2 assignments same day

Wednesday 10/8:
  - M3 remote evening (inpatient) + O'Toole mammo + Skull Base
  â†’ Working 3 assignments same day
```

**John Johnson Pattern:**
```
Monday 10/13:
  - M1 on-site (inpatient) + Cardiac (subspecialty)
  â†’ Working 2 assignments same day

Tuesday 10/14:
  - Remote Breast (outpatient) + Cardiac (subspecialty)
  â†’ Working 2 assignments same day
```

**Interpretation:**
- Subspecialty work (Skull Base, Cardiac) runs **concurrent with primary rotations**
- Not separate shifts, but additional responsibilities during the day
- These should NOT count as separate rotation assignments for fairness

### 3. Geographic Distribution

**On-Site Locations (in order of frequency):**
1. **Washington:** MRI (most common), Breast
2. **Encinitas:** Breast, MRI, General
3. **Poway:** PET (most common), MRI, General
4. **National City:** General, PET, Breast, MRI (least frequent)

**Observation:** Some radiologists may prefer certain locations based on:
- Proximity to home
- Familiarity with site workflow
- Modality expertise at that location

### 4. Workload Intensity Patterns

**Busy Days (12-13 total shifts):**
- Monday 10/6: 12 shifts
- Monday 10/13: 13 shifts
- Wednesday 10/15: 13 shifts
- Thursday 10/16: 13 shifts

**Light Days (3-5 total shifts):**
- Saturday/Sunday: 3-5 shifts (weekend coverage only)

**Observation:** Weekends operate with minimal staff (20-25% of weekday volume)

**Take-aways**
**Data already shows natural pools** - 8 hospital-leaning, 7 outpatient-leaning
**Weekend should stay unified** - Already fair, good cross-training opportunity
**Some subspecialty work (e.g. cardiac, skull base) is concurrent** - Doesn't count toward rotation fairness
**Geographic preferences exist**
