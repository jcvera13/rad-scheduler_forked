## Background

Our schedule can be split into 2 main categories:

1. Inpatient

- Consists of mostly emergency room/hospital diagnostic work and high-end IR procedures
- All inpatient work comes from Mercy Hospital San Diego

2. Outpatient
  - Consists of mostly high end subspecialized diagnostic work and basic procedures
  - Most of our outpatient work comes from IHS sites


## Core Specialties

Each SHIPMG radiologist has the ability to read/rotate through at least one of the following core specialties. These are the same Core Rotation names used in Qgenda


_1._ _Mercy_
2. IR
3. Mammography (MG)
4. MRI
5. PET
6. General (GEN)

## List of Locations

As a group, SHIPMG radiologists cover 6 sites:
1. Mercy Hospital San Diego
2. Washington Hillcrest IHS
3. Encinitas IHS
4. Poway IHS
5. Kearny Mesa IHS (every other week)
6. National City IHS (every other non-Kearny Mesa week)


## Mercy Hospital Hillcrest Location
There are 7 rotations at Mercy Hospital every weekDAY:
1. IR-1; requires IR onsite
2. IR-2; requires IR onsite
3. M0; requires _Mercy_ remote
4. M1; requires _Mercy_ onsite
5. M2; requires _Mercy_ remote
6. M3; requires _Mercy_ remote
7. O'toole Breast Center; requires MG onsite


## Washington Hillcrest IHS
This site requires 1 mammographer onsite M, F to do procedures; and 1 MRI radiologist to be onsite T, W, Th to do procedures.

1. Requires 1 MG onsite M, F
2. Requires 1 MRI onsite T,W,Th


## Encinitas IHS
This site requires 1 radiologist onsite every weekDAY to cover contrast reactions


1. Requires 1 MRI onsite M
2. Requires 1 MG onsite T, W
3. Requires 1 Gen onsite Th, F


## Poway IHS
This site requires 1 radiologist onsite every weekDAY to cover contrast reactions


1. Requires 1 Gen onsite M,T
2. Requires 1 MRI onsite W
3. Requires 1 PET onsite Th, F


## Kearny Mesa IHS
We read the scans coming from this site, every other week (alternating with National City). This is a remote location that does not need any radiologist specifically assigned to this site.


## National City IHS
We read the scans coming from this site every other week(alternating with Kearny Mesa). This site requires 1 radiologist onsite every weekDAY to cover contrast reactions.


1. Requires 1 GEN onsite M, T, W, Th, F


## Remote Rotations
Once all of the rotations requiring onsite staff have an assigned radiologist, the rest of the work can be assigned as remote work.


The number of remote radiologists required per day are listed in Schedule Grid above


## WeekDAY Summary
- We cover 5 sites every weekday
- KM weeks and NC weeks alternate
- Mercy Hospital requires 2 IR doctors and 1 to 2 DR doctors onsite every weekday.
- Most of the outpatient sites require 1 radiologist onsite either for procedures or for contrast coverage
- Any radiologist who is not needed onsite can do their rotation remotely


## Week END Coverage
Each of the following rotations requires 1 radiologist to cover, per weekend day:

1. IR Call
2. M0
3. EP
4. Dx-Call
5. Weekend IHS MRI
6. Weekend IHS PET


## IR Weekend Call
-These calls are evenly split amongst the 4 IR doctors:

  - SS
  - DA
  - TR
  - SF


-IR Doctor is assigned to the entire weekend (both Saturday and Sunday)


## Diagnostic Mercy WeekEND

- M0, EP, Dx-Call are evenly split amongst the 15 diagnostic radiologists.

Preferences:

-MTB and BT like M0 scheduled on the same day as EP (i.e. M0
Saturday AND EP Saturday).

-Others would like M0 scheduled on the same weekEND as EP, but
NOT the same Day (i.e Saturday M0 and Sunday EP); _For now make_
_this the default assignment if you are unsure of a radiologist's_
_preference._

-A few like to have EP and Dx-call scheduled on the same weekEND
(i.e. Saturday EP and Saturday Dx-Call all scheduled together)


## Diagnostic IHS WeekEND

-Weekend IHS MRI evenly split amongst 6 radiologists: GA,MTB, EC, EL, JC, and BT
-Weekend IHS PET evenly split amongst 4 radiologists: MTB, MG, EK, and MS


## Schedule Grids
(see above schedule grid section)

## Additional Considerations

-Subspeciality rotations

-Conferences

-Radiologist site preferences

-Days off

-Requests


## Subspecialized Rotations

These subspecialized rotations need to be assigned as additional
work to one of the radiologists already assigned to a core rotation


-Cardiac Imaging
  - Assign to JJ or BT, whomever is already on a Mercy Rotation

-Skull Base
  - Assign to JC, JCV or BT; whomever is already assigned to an IHS rotation

NM Brain
  - Assign to MS, JCV, or BT; whomever is already assigned to an IHS rotation

Those would participate in conference will be paid $250/hr. Exception is for H&N tumor board, which is paid $500/hr.


- Chest Conference

  - 1st and 3rd Thursday of every month

- Cardiac Cath Conference

  - Every Thursday

- H&N Tumor Board

  - 2nd and 4th Friday of every month

- Neurovascular MDM quarterly

  - JCV will alert scheduler when its assigned (once per quarter)

- *Pulmonary Resident Conference

## Radiologist Site Preferences

Our radiologists live all across San Diego, ranging from National
City to Carlsbad.


When possible, we try to fill all of the necessary onsite rotations
while also minimizing travel distances.


Certain rotations, like M1 need to be split evenly amongst all
participating radiologists; thus location preference should not be
accounted for on this rotation.

## Days Off


- Number of vacation days

  - Radiologists will pick 5 weeks of vacation every 6 months

  - These vacation days will be the first to be placed into Qgenda


- Number of OFF ALL Day

  - Once all core rotations are assigned, any radiologist not assigned to a core rotation,

and not on vacation, will be given an OFF ALL DAY.

  - These should be evenly split amongst all Level 1's by the end of the year


- Admin Days Off

  - Leadership roles can request additional days off to do administrative work


## Admin Days


|Roles|Radiologist|Admin Days Off|
|---|---|---|
|Medical Director|SS|22|
|Vice Medical Director|MTB|12|
|IHS Medical Director|MTB|-|

## Requests


- Radiologists can submit requests for certain rotations or days off into

Qgenda


- Radiologists are capped with the number of requests they can make:

  - 1 running request for the entire year (i.e. work remotely for every Thursday to

cover cardiac catheter conference)

      - All requests will be reviewed annually to make sure there are no overlapping conflicts

      - Requests will be honored when possible, but are subject to change when needed to

complete group coverage

  - 1 flexible request per week for urgent issues

      - approved and denied by Scheduler on case to case basis


## Summary

1. There are 7 inpatient rotations and 7-8 outpatient rotations every weekDAY
2. There are 4 inpatient rotations and 2 outpatient rotations every weekEND
3. Core rotation should be assigned to a radiologist who reads in that core
specialty
4. Additional subspecialized rotations should be assigned to radiologists who read
in that subspeciality AND are already assigned to a core rotation that day
5. Assign monthly conferences evenly amongst participants
6. Account for travel distance/location preference when possible
7. Ensure balanced number of OFF ALL DAY for all level 1's
8. Allow radiologists with leadership roles to be assigned additional ADMIN time
9. Build a fair system for schedule requests/changes
